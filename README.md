This project is focused on analyzing customer churn and building predictive models to identify factors influencing customer retention and attrition.

Collected Data:
Gathered relevant customer data for churn analysis.

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior.
Visualized insights using charts and graphs.

Model Building:
Developed machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Evaluated models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Visualization & Reporting:
Created visualizations to present key findings.
Summarized insights that can aid in business decision-making.

Deployment :
Integrated the model into a user interface or deployed it for practical use Flask app.

Technologies Used
Python for data analysis and modeling.
HTML and CSS for presenting results or building a web interface.
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
